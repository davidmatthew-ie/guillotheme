## Guillotheme 

### Description

Guillotheme chops the front-end (i.e. the head) right off your theme by restricting access to the front-end (specifically, the WordPress-generated front-end permalinks). These are unnecessary in the case of a headless or decoupled set-up, and could potentially confuse non-technical users or other content editors when WordPress is being used headlessly (i.e. purely for its CMS capabilities).

### Features

* Organised and object-oriented code that adheres to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards).
